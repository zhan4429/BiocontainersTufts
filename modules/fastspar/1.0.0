module-whatis   "Description:  FastSpar is a C++ implementation of the SparCC algorithm which is up to several thousand times faster than the original Python2 release and uses much less memory. The FastSpar implementation provides threading support and a p-value estimator which accounts for the possibility of repetitious data permutations."
